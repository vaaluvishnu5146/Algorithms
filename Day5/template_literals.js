// Dear ${managerName},
// I am writing to let you know that I am pregnant and plan on taking maternity leave. Given that my due date is 12th August 2022, I would like to start working from home from 22nd July 2022. I plan on taking 26 weeks of maternity leave.
// I have approached Jude Connolly about stepping in as acting production coordinator and, at this early stage, she has expressed her willingness to do so. The Jupiter production run should be complete by the end of July, so it ought not be affected by my absence. I intend to fully assist you in handing over my workload closer to my due date.
// Should you need anything from me during my maternity leave, you can contact me by phone (078 2714 1284) or email (abigail.hodgson@lcmail.co.uk).
// Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions or if there is anything I can do to help make this process easier. Thank you for your time.

// Yours Sincerely,
// ${employeeName}`;
